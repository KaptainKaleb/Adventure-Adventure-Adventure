# Adventure Adventure Adventure
Attempting to make a simple, text based, adventure game!
I'm going to try to do it in Python.
Very new at coding, I'm not very good.
This is just for fun and learning.

# Plan
## Story
Story will be contained using methods that consist mostly of `print` and `time.wait`, and will
be organized into seperate python files (as a module). These story and text-based choice 
methods will all be contained in chp/chpX.py

## Saving
Saving will be done using a basic text-file save game. It will be difficult since Python 
doesn't like to work well with writing new data to a text file, but it is possible. These
auxillary methods will be contained in lib/XX.py

## Main Game
One .py program (currently named aaa.py (for Adventure Adventure Adventure)) will handle
all the calls to the other libraries, and basic choice logic.
